You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Prompt - Mongoose (DB Connect)
You are a backend developer working on a Next.js application with Mongoose and TypeScript. 

Your task is to,
- Create a new file `lib/mongodb.ts` in the lib folder of a Next.js application. 
- Set up a Mongoose database connection to MongoDB using TypeScript with proper types (avoid using any). 
- Cache the connection to prevent multiple connections during development. 
- Write clear and concise comments explaining key parts of the code. 
- Make sure the code is clean, readable, and production-ready.
